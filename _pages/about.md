I am a Computer Science PhD Student for the School of Science and Engineering at Tulane University under the supervision of Prof. Nicholas Mattei and a Computer Scientist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory under the mentorship of Dr. Jaelle Scheuerman. 

My research interest is in Human AI Interaction. I explore the unique challenges that arise when a solution to a problem cannot be fully automated and a user is required to collaborate with some form of automation to achieve a common goal. I aim to build more effective autonomous assistants that focus on enhancing user understanding, reducing cognitive load, and promoting more rational decision-making processes. 

I have presented and published my work in multiple venues, such as, Advancing Artificial Intelligence through Theory of Mind (ToM4AI), Naval Application of Machine Learning (NAML), Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN), and more. 

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I graduated with honors from Southeastern Louisiana University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
